This is a widget that allows you to simply add a map of tweets using Twitter and Google Maps.  It's easy!

<%= twitter_map(:username => "twitterusername", :map_style => "width: 640px; height: 480px;", :map_zoom => 8) %>

Viola!  You now have a Twitter map!  

Installation:

To install, just do 

script/plugin install git://github.com/johnnyb/railsgeotwit.git

Of course, we have many more options.  Here they are:

** Required Options **
username: the user whose tweets you want

Also, of the "normal options" below, one of map_div_id, map_style, or map_class need to be set to properly load the map (in order for the width to be set).

** Normal Options **
map_style: CSS style of the map div 
map_zoom: the zoom level for the map (default 8)
map_type: the type of google map you want - ROADMAP / SATELLITE / HYBRID / TERRAIN (default ROADMAP)
twit_count: how many tweets to load
map_twit_count: max number of tweets to plot
map_div_id: if you want to force a name for the map DIV, put it here
map_class: CSS class for the map div
disable_tweet_title: set to true if you don't want the tweets as map marker hover titles


** Advanced Options **
marker_callback: if you don't like how I'm displaying your tweets, set this to be a javascript function to do it for you
map_var: if you already have a map or want to force it to be named something, put that name here

** Super-Advanced Options **
suppress_google_map_creation: set to true if you don't want us to create your map for you
suppress_map_div: set to true if you don't want us to spit out the DIV for the map
suppress_google_map_js_loading: set to true if you don't want us handling your google map JS loading

** Non-Rails Usage **

A javascript file is included in public/javascripts that you can use for non-Rails applications.  It requires a little more doing, but here is how you would achieve basically the same result:

<div id="twitter_map" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="twittermap.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/PUTTWITTERUSERNAMEHERE.json?callback=map_tweets&amp;count=20"></script>
